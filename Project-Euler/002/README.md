# Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

Constraints

Output Format

For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.
